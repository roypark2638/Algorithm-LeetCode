|  #  | Title  | Solution | Basic Idea |
| --- | ------------- | -------- | ------------ |
|  107  | [Minimum Characters For Words](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Minimum%20Characters%20For%20Words)  | [Swift](https://github.com/roypark2638/Algorithm-Leetcode/blob/main/MinimumCharactersForWords.playground/Contents.swift)  | O(n * I) time, O(c) space - where n is the number of words, I is the length of the longest word, and c is the number of unique characters across all words. |
|  106  | [Height Balanced Binary Tree](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Height%20Balanced%20Binary%20Tree)  | [Swift](https://github.com/roypark2638/Algorithm-Leetcode/blob/main/HeightBalancedBinaryTree.playground/Contents.swift)  | Recursively calculate the left and right subtree heights from each node. determine if the subtree rooted at that node is balanced. If you make it through the entire tree without finding any unbalanced subtrees, and if you determine that the heights of the main two subtrees aren't more than 1 apart, then the entire tree is balanced. |
|  105  | [Non-Constrcutible Change](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Non-Constructible%20Change)  | [Swift](https://github.com/roypark2638/Algorithm-Leetcode/blob/main/Non-ConstructibleChange.playground/Contents.swift)  | Create a variable to store the amount of change that you can curerntly create up to. Sort all of your coins, and loop through them in ascending order. At every iteration, compare the current coin to the maount of change that you can currently create up to. |
|  104  | [Tournament Winner](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Tournament%20Winner)  | [Swift](https://github.com/roypark2638/Algorithm-Leetcode/blob/main/TournamentWinner.playground/Contents.swift)  | 1. Create a map [String: Int]<br/>2. Loop each competitions and increase winner's point at the map<br/>3. Return the highest score of the team|
|  103  | [Sorted Squared Array](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Sorted%20Squared%20Array)  | [Swift](https://github.com/roypark2638/Algorithm-Leetcode/blob/main/SortedSquaredArray.playground/Pages/Pointer-Method.xcplaygroundpage/Contents.swift)  | 2 methods are available and the optimal solution. <br/>1. Create array with the same length of the given array<br/>2. Create pointers for left, right and index<br/>3. Loop while left <= right.<br/> - Fill the array from the back with larger number. <br/> - Move the pointer and index accordingly |
|  102  | [Validate Subsequence](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Validate%20Subsequence)  | [Swift](https://github.com/roypark2638/Algorithm-Leetcode/blob/main/ValidateSubsequence.playground/Contents.swift)  | 1.Set sequence index = 0 and final index = sequence.count<br/>2. Increment index<br/> - If sequence == array -> increment both<br/> - If sequence != array -> increment array only<br/>3. If sequence index == sequence.count -> true<br/>Time O(N), Space O(1)|
|  101  | [Two Number Sum](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Two%20Number%20Sum)  | [Swift](https://github.com/roypark2638/Algorithm-Leetcode/blob/main/TwoNumberSum.playground/Pages/HashMap-Method.xcplaygroundpage/Contents.swift)  | 1. HashMap. Time: O(n), Sapce: O(n)<br/>2. Sort and search with two pointers O(n) and O(1) space|
